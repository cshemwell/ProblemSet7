# ProblemSet7

sorry for turning this is late. I honestly put a lot of time into trying to figure these out last week, but I was only able to get so far on my own. 
-popen was a mystery
-fprintf wasn't working

-but as of today 11/13, zach was able to show me that the code was virtually right, it's just gnuplot commands not working. It's just the gnuplot commands that don't seem to work. (even though they are exactly as you have on the github repository).
